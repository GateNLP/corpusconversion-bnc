# Conversion of the original British National Corpus documents, XML edition to GATE

The files in this repository can be used to convert the original XML fiels from the BNC corpus
(see http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/2554) to usable GATE documents.

NOTE: this contains a pipeline for doing this which depends on the following tools and software, not included here:
* the runPipeline.sh command from yodie-tools (gateservice2.dcs.shef.ac.uk:/data/git/yodie/yodie-tools)
* TBD
